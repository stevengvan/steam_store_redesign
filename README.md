# Steam Store Page Redesign

Next.js project to change the styling and UI of Steam's store page. This project is meant to further practice usage of Next.js and the page redesign is only to showcase another style design based on personal preferences. Therefore, all data shown in the pages are static and are provided in the repository. For that reason users will find reused images and game information.
